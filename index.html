    Welcome to my page!
    <br />
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello!  My name is Brett Chance and I have started this webpage for a school project.  I am new to this so I hope I can get everything working properly. First, a couple of paragraphs about myself.  I currently serve in the United States Air Force and have been in for almost 23 years. I will be retiring at the end of this year and am trying to get my education wrapped up before I leave active duty.  I am currently stationed at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, but have been fortunate to have been stationed numerous places both state-side and overseas.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is paragraph 2</p>
