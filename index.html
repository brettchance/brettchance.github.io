    Welcome to my page!
    <br />
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello!  My name is Brett Chance and I have started this webpage for a school project.  I am new to this so I hope I can get everything working properly. First, a couple of paragraphs about myself.  I currently serve in the United States Air Force and have been in for almost 23 years. I will be retiring at the end of this year and am trying to get my education wrapped up before I leave active duty.  I am currently stationed at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, but have been fortunate to have been stationed numerous places both state-side and overseas.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am not at work I enjoy spending time with my wife and our pets.  We currently have two dogs, Frazer and Homer, and a cat named Georgia.  My job has me traveling a lot to other bases for various meetings and inspections.  So I value my time relaxing at home with our family. My hobbies include working out, mostly lifting weights, running, and Peleton, and playing guitar. I have played since I was 12 years old and should be much better than I am.  I also enjoy the outdoors, when it is not too hot here in Louisiana.  Well that is a little about me and I hope to learn a lot and am able to make this webpage presentable.</p>
